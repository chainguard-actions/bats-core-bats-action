# Setup Bats and Bats libraries

This GitHub Action installs [Bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and the four major bats libraries:

* [bats-support](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-support)
* [bats-assert](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-assert)
* [bats-detik](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-detik)
* [bats-file](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-file)

The action can be also instructed to select which libraries to install.
While Linux is fully supported, windows and macos runners should work as well, check the [specific](#windows-and-macos-support) readme part.

## How to use it

``` yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
   my_test:
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     name: Install Bats and bats libs
     steps:
       - name: Checkout
         uses: actions/checkout@v5
       - name: Setup Bats and bats libs
         id: setup-bats
         uses: bats-core/bats-action@4.0.0
       - name: My test
         shell: bash
         env:
          BATS_LIB_PATH: ${{ steps.setup-bats.outputs.lib-path }}
          TERM: xterm
         run: bats test/my-test
```

By default the action will pass the `BATS_LIB_PATH` value as output `lib-path`.
You can use it like the below example and load the libraries in your tests with:

```bash
_tests_helper() {
    export BATS_LIB_PATH=${BATS_LIB_PATH:-"/usr/lib"}
    bats_load_library bats-support
    bats_load_library bats-assert
    bats_load_library bats-file
    bats_load_library bats-detik/detik.bash
}
```

## Libraries Path

For each of the Bats libraries, you can choose to install them in the default location (`/usr/lib/bats-<lib-name>` for linux) or specify a custom path.

For example, if you want to install `bats-support` in the `./test/bats-support` directory, you can configure it as follows:


``` yaml
      [...]
       - name: Setup Bats and Bats libs
         id: setup-bats
         uses: bats-core/bats-action@4.0.0
         with:
           support-path: ${{ github.workspace }}/test/bats-support
      [...]
```

## Authenticated requests

The action performs a number of calls against github API URLs to discover bats release numbers and download assets. To help against github rate limits, you can pass a valid github token so that those requests are authenticated. Example:

``` yaml
      [...]
       - name: Setup Bats and Bats libs
         id: setup-bats
         uses: bats-core/bats-action@4.0.0
         with:
           github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      [...]
```

If you don't have a token (for example, because you're using this action in a non-github pipeline), you can omit the token and things shoud work just fine, however you'll be slightly more likely to run into github rate limits, so keep this in mind if you encounter problems.


## About Caching

The caching mechanism for the `bats binary` is always available. However, the caching for the `bats libraries` is dependent on the location of each library path. If a library is located within the $HOME directory, caching is supported. Conversely, if a library is located outside the $HOME directory (which is the default location per each library), caching is not supported. This is due to a known limitation with sudo and the cache action, as detailed in this GitHub issue: https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/946.

**If you want to cache bats libraries you must install them inside HOME directory**.
For instance this is an example that will use the github workspace handle (works for linux/win/mac):

```yaml
      [...]
       - name: Setup Bats and bats libs
         id: setup-bats
         uses: bats-core/bats-action@4.0.0
         with:
           support-path: "${{ github.workspace }}/tests/bats-support"
           assert-path: "${{ github.workspace }}/tests/bats-assert"
           detik-path: "${{ github.workspace }}/tests/bats-detik"
           file-path: "${{ github.workspace }}/tests/bats-file"
      [...]
```

## Windows and macos support

* Macos is fully supported for both default path and custom home path, just be aware that under `/usr` only `/usr/local/` is writable,
the rest is read only (you may consider to use an home path leverage the cache).
  * default libraries installation: `/usr/local/lib`
  * default temp directory (for dev testing): `/tmp`
* Windows is fully supported as well, however they may be some hiccup around the libraries installation in another drive that is not `C:`.
Please report any issue.
  * default libraries installation: `/c/Users/runneradmin`
  * default temp directory (for dev testing): `$HOME/AppData/Local/Temp`
